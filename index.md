I obtained my degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Bras√≠lia
in 2019. As my final project, I developed a lossless compressor for the colour channel of a point cloud image.

I am interested in computer programming and mathematics in general, and in signal processing in particular.

Tools I am comfortable with:
 - Python 3, NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib.
 - LaTeX

I know the basics of:
 - Pandas
 - C/C++
 - Matlab

Some of the things I want to learn next:
 - Machine learning and statistics
 - A functional programming language (e.g. Haskell)
